#### A simple translator to convert Gen Alpha's new slang into text readable by old people
##### By Sam Rohrbach

This project is also on my website, [samrohrbach.space](https://samrohrbach.space). 

Have you ever talked to an "iPad kid" and heard words like *skibidi*, *rizz*, *ohio*, and *fanum tax*? So have I. 

Have you ever felt completely lost in those conversations? So have I. 

Have you wished there was a translator for this new slang? So have I. So I made this translator.

For the full list of words translated, look at SkibidiRizz.js in the root directory. To add new words or change existing ones, create an issue or, if you really know what you're doing, submit a pull request.
